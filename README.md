Building a meta system for transferable characters between carts in PICO-8.  Indulge crazy combinations and level up across worlds!

This project started out as a conversation about games like Bard's Tale I-III, the Ultima series, and Mass Effect, which allowed players to import characters from previous games: powers, skills, and inventories at least a little intact.  We started imagining what it would be like for other games, particularly those in PICO-8, to import characters from other cartridges.  

What if Pac-Man and Bionic Commando teamed up to make their way through Castlevania?  These are the kind of questions we yearn to answer through gameplay.

This project began June 2020.
